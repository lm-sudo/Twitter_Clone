## General Info
A project that utilizes Laravel to put together several software principles that I have learned so far. This project is a social media application which allows users to share their ideas, follow each other, and comment on each others' ideas. I chose to work on such a project because I believe that social media applications possess many characteristics desired and which are practical for modern applications such as: security policies, administrative tools, and a clean user interface. 

## Technologies

* Laravel 11.8.0
* PHP 8.3
* SQL(MySQL)

* Docker 4.17.0
